	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate open source software (OSS) success using longitudinal data on OSS projects. We find that restrictive OSS licenses have an adverse impact on OSS success. On further analysis, restrictive OSS license is found to be negatively associated with developer interest, but is positively associated with the interest of non-developer users and project administrators. We also show that developer and non-developer interest in the OSS project and the project activity levels in any time period significantly affect the project success measures in subsequent time period. The implications of our findings for OSS research and practice are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Context Open source (FLOSS) project survivability is an important piece of information for many open source stakeholders. Coordinators of open source projects would like to know the chances for the survival of the projects they coordinate. Companies are also interested in knowing how viable a project is in order to either participate or invest in it, and volunteers want to contribute to vivid projects.Objective The purpose of this article is the application of survival analysis techniques for estimating the future development of a FLOSS project.Method},

@article{Izquierdo-Cortazar2010,
	Abstract = {Plenty of companies try to access Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) products, but they find a lack of documentation and responsiveness from the libre software community. But not all of the communities have the same capacity to answer questions. Even more, most of these communities are driven by volunteers which in most of the cases work on their spare time. Thus, how active and reliable is a community and how can we measure their risks in terms of quality of the community is a main issue to be resolved. Trying to determine how a community runs and look for their weaknesses is a way to improve themselves and, also, a way to obtain trustworthiness from an enterprise point of view. In order to have a statistical basement, around 1400 FLOSS projects have been studied to create thresholds which will help to determine a projecttextquoterights current status compared with this initial set of FLOSS communities.},

@article{Weiss2005,
	Abstract = {What makes an open source project successful? In this paper we show that the traditional factors of success of open source projects, such as number of downloads, deployments or commits are sometimes inconvenient or even insufficient. We then correlate success of an open source project with its popularity on the Web. We show several ideas of how such popularity could be measured using Web search engines and provide experimental results from quantitative analysis of the proposed measures on representative large samples of open source projects from SourceForge.},

@article{Wahyudin2007,
	Abstract = {Purpose -- In response to the increasing number of open-source software (OSS) project initiatives and the increasing demand of OSS products as alternative solutions by industries, it is important for particular stakeholders such as the project host/supporter project-leading teams, and prospective customers to determine whether a project initiative is likely to be sustainable and is worth supporting. This paper aims to propose a concept of ``health'' indicators and an evaluation process that can help to get a status overview of OSS projects in a timely fashion and predict project survivability based on the project data available on web repositories.

Design/methodology/approach -- For initial empirical evaluation of the concept, the indicators are applied to well-known web-based OSS projects (Apache Tomcat and Apache HTTP Server) and the results are compared with challenged projects (Apache Xindice and Apache Slide). The results are discussed with OSS experts to investigate the external validity of the indicators.

Findings -- From a software project management point of view, a typical web-based OSS project can be viewed as a web-engineering process, since most OSS projects exploit the benefits of a web platform and enable the project community to collaborate using web-based project tools and repositories such as mailing lists, bug trackers, and versioning systems (CVS/SVN) to deliver web systems and applications. These repositories can provide rich collections of process data, and artifacts which can be analyzed to better understand the project status.},

@article{Crowston2005,
	Abstract = {Metaphors, such as the Cathedral and Bazaar, used to describe the organization of FLOSS projects typically place them in sharp contrast to proprietary development by emphasizing FLOSS's distinctive social and communications structures. But what do we really know about the communication patterns of FLOSS projects? How generalizable are the projects that have been studied? Is there consistency across FLOSS projects? Questioning the assumption of distinctiveness is important because practitioner--advocates from within the FLOSS community rely on features of social structure to describe and account for some of the advantages of FLOSS production. To address this question, we examined 120 project teams from SourceForge, representing a wide range of FLOSS project types, for their communications centralization as revealed in the interactions in the bug tracking system. We found that FLOSS development teams vary widely in their communications centralization, from projects completely centered on one developer to projects that are highly decentralized and exhibit a distributed pattern of conversation between developers and active users. We suggest, therefore, that it is wrong to assume that FLOSS projects are distinguished by a particular social structure merely because they are FLOSS. Our findings suggest that FLOSS projects might have to work hard to achieve the expected development advantages which have been assumed to flow from "going open." In addition, the variation in communications structure across projects means that communications centralization is useful for comparisons between FLOSS teams. We found that larger FLOSS teams tend to have more decentralized communication patterns, a finding that suggests interesting avenues for further research examining, for example, the relationship between communications structure and code modularity.},

@article{Bessen2001,
	Abstract = {E software, developed by volunteers, appears counter to the conventional wisdom that private provision of public goods is socially more efficient. But complexity makes a difference. Under standard models, development contracts for specialized software may be difficult to write and ownership rights do not necessarily elicit socially optimal effort. I consider three mechanisms that improve the likelihood that firms can obtain the software they need: pre-packaged software, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Free/Open Source software (FOSS). I show that with complex software, some firms will choose to participate in FOSS over both "make or buy" and this increases social welfare. In general, FOSS complements proprietary provision, rather than replacing it. Pre-packaged software can coexist in the marketplace with FOSS: pre-packaged software addresses common uses with limited feature sets, while firms with specialized, more complex needs use FOSS.},
